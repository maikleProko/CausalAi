'''
The Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm is one of the most general purpose algorithms for causal discovery that can be used for both tabular and time series data, 
of both continuous and discrete types. Briefly, the PC algorithm works in two steps, it first identifies the undirected causal graph, and then (partially) 
directs the edges. In the first step, we check for the existence of a causal connection between every pair of variables by checking if there exists a condition 
set (a subset of variables excluding the two said variables), conditioned on which, the two variables are independent. In the second step, the edges are directed 
by identifying colliders. Note that the edge orientation strategy of the PC algorithm may result in partially directed graphs. In the case of time series data, 
the additional information about the time steps associated with each variable can also be used to direct the edges.

The PC algorithm makes four core assumptions: 1. Causal Markov condition, which implies that two variables that are d-separated in a causal graph are 
probabilistically independent, 2. faithfulness, i.e., no conditional independence can hold unless the Causal Markov condition is met, 3. no hidden 
confounders, and 4. no cycles in the causal graph. For time series data, it makes the additional assumption of stationarity, i.e., the properties of 
a random variable is agnostic to the time step.

Our implementation of the PC algorithm for time series currently only supports lagged causal relationship discovery, i.e., no instantaneous causal relationships.
